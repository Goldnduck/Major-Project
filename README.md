Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the need for accurate and timely diagnosis.
This study addresses this challenge by proposing a hybrid machine learning model, MLP-GA-RF, that combines the strengths of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Random Forest (RF). 
GA efficiently optimizes the MLP's parameters, enhancing its predictive performance, while RF acts as a robust classifier for final diagnosis. 
To further improve real-time diagnostic capability, the system is integrated with a fog computing framework. 
By processing data closer to the source, fog computing significantly reduces latency and minimizes reliance on centralized cloud infrastructure. 
This decentralized approach ensures rapid data analysis, making the system particularly suitable for critical healthcare applications and remote patient monitoring.
The model is rigorously evaluated against conventional classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. 
Results demonstrate that the MLP-GA-RF model consistently outperforms baseline models, offering enhanced accuracy and reliable predictions. 
The integration of fog computing with an optimized hybrid model presents a significant advancement in heart disease prediction, contributing to more effective medical decision-making and improved healthcare outcomes.
